## üì• Installation & Setup

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Phoenixarjun/Movie-Recommender-using-ML.git
cd Movie-Recommender-using-ML
````

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Manage large files with Git LFS (if needed)

```bash
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.pkl"
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Track pickle files with Git LFS"
```

### Prepare data and train the model (optional)

If you want to retrain or update the model:

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```

### Run the backend server

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

## üñ• Usage

* Open the frontend in your browser
* Search for your favorite movie
* Browse recommended movies with posters, ratings, and release years
* Use pagination to explore more titles

## üîß How it Works

1. **Data Processing:** Movie metadata is vectorized using TF-IDF and processed via NLTK for tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
2. **Model Training:** FastAI and scikit-learn calculate cosine similarity on vectors to build the recommendation matrix.
3. **Backend API:** FastAPI exposes endpoints to query movie recommendations in real-time.
4. **Frontend UI:** JavaScript fetches API data, dynamically rendering movie cards and managing pagination for smooth UX.
